    GPU statistics are displayed in scrolling format with one line
    per sampling interval. Metrics to be monitored can be adjusted
    based on the width of terminal window. Monitoring is limited to
    a maximum of 16 devices. If no devices are specified, then up to
    first 16 supported devices under natural enumeration (starting
    with GPU index 0) are used for monitoring purpose.
    It is supported on Tesla, GRID, Quadro and limited GeForce products
    for Kepler or newer GPUs under x64 and ppc64 bare metal Linux.
    Note: On MIG-enabled GPUs, querying the utilization of encoder,
    decoder, jpeg, ofa, gpu, and memory is not currently supported.
